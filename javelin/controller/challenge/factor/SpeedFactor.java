/**
 * Only walk and fly are supported.
 *
 * Burrow would be interesting but it could be a big change and I can imagine
 * the AI not wanting to unburrow (if it was done in a similar fashion to
 * Starcraft 2).
 *
 * Swim would only be useful on a single map right now and only in a small area.
 *
 * Fly means that the character can fly over any obstacle but cannot really fly
 * high up enough for 3D combat mechanics to be needed. This of course is just
 * an approximation to the d20 system but is simpler, fun and easier to code.
 * Since this approach has about the same number of benefits from good/perfect
 * flight maneuverabilty as deficits from poor/clumsy the CR value is
 * approximated to the average: .6 for flight.
 *
