In the Art of War scenario, your only goal is to capture all the hostile towns in the world map. City management, gold, items and upgrades are non-existant - just progressively amass an army big enough to win each battle and focus on keeping as many units alive as you can so that they can fight another day!

After each battle, your units will be automatically upgraded depending on how much experience they have. New allies will also join you after each victory, as the tales of your glory increasingly grow your reputation.

Don't forget to set up camp in-between battles so that your team can be fully rested before the next engagement!
