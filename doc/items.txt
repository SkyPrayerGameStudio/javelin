EIDOLON

A magic stone that, when spent summons an ally for the duration of the battle.

POTIONS

Potions are one-use items that produce a spell-like effect on the user. Their effect is automatic - no prerequisites or rolls are needed. 

PRECIOUS ITEMS

Do not have any use other than selling them for their full value in gold - but if you're lucky some of these objects can sell for very high prices indeed!

SCROLLS

A scroll is a one-use item that works like a magic spell but requires its reader to have at least one mental attribute score (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) equal or higher to 10 + spell level. The reader's caster level must also be higher than the spell's caster level (see the spell guide for more information). The Spellcraft skill grants bonuses to these calculations.  

TRANSPORT
