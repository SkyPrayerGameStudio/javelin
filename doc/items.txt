EIDOLON

A magic stone that, when spent summons an ally for the duration of the battle.

POTIONS

Potions are one-use items that produce a spell-like effect on the user. Their effect is automatic - no prerequisites or rolls are needed. 

PRECIOUS ITEMS

Do not have any use other than selling them for their full value in gold - but if you're lucky some of these objects can sell for very high prices indeed!

SCROLLS

A scroll is a one-use item that works like a magic spell but requires its reader to have at least one mental attribute score (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) equal or higher to 10 + spell level. The reader's caster level must also be higher than the spell's caster level (see the spell guide for more information). The Spellcraft skill grants bonuses to these calculations.  

TRANSPORT

Airship: avoids combat, costs $16/day.

Carriage: reduces chance of battle, costs $2/day.

Ship: avoids combat on water, very slow on land.

WANDS, STAVES AND RODS

Each of those items allow certain types of spells to be cast. Wands don't need to be equiped and can be used at any time straight out of the inventory, and contain a limited number of charges. Staves are higher-level wands that need to be equiped, prior to battle, before they can be used. Both Wands and Staves have a limited number of uses and become worthless after these charges are spent. A player also needs to have enough knowledge to be able to use these items - usually either through the Spellcraft or Use Magic Device skills.

Rods are similar to staves in that they need to be equipped before being used - but they don't have a limited number of charges nor they require magical expertise to be used. Note that each squad member can only have one Rod or Staff equipped at once at any given time.
