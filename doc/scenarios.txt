Javelin offers a few game modes:

Campaign: a long, epic quest to retrieve the seven Relics from deep inside their ancient Temples. It presents all of the game features, including mini-games. This is recommended for newcomers.

Dungeon world: conquer increasingly difficult dungeons on a simplified world map.

Scenario: a shorter mode, offering a challenge in which you have to capture all enemy towns. It has a reduced number of game features but is more suitable to play during a single session.

You can read more about each mode by pressing F1 after the game has started. Pressing h will list all help guides available in-game.
