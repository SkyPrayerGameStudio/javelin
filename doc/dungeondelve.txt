In this roguelike mode, everything you'll need can be found on the dungeon floors below you. Your ultimate objective is to find the Orb of Guffin at the lowest level and then bring it safely back to the surface.

Although this mode is designed to allow you to focus on your constant descent, some circumstances (or just bad luck!) may force you to backtrack into previous floors - especially if there are known features you left behind that can be of use before presisng on forwards again!

Remember you can also always leave the dungeon and rest on the wilderness outside, although it might not be a good idea to backtrack all the way up once you've made a decent amount of progress on your way down...

This game mode is supposed to be challenging: it may take time, experience and a good amount of luck to see it through!
